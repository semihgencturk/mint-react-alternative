# Mint Official Website

I developed this website for a student community in [Yildiz Technical University](https://yildiz.edu.tr/en)

## About Project

- I designed and developed this website by myself in two days. 
- I used React and styled-components for css. 
- I get the icons from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
- I imported the font family from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Oxygen?preview.text=%EA%B7%B8%EB%93%A4%EC%9D%98%20%EC%9E%A5%EB%B9%84%EC%99%80%20%EA%B8%B0%EA%B5%AC%EB%8A%94%20%EB%AA%A8%EB%91%90%20%EC%82%B4%EC%95%84%20%EC%9E%88%EB%8B%A4.&preview.text_type=custom&query=oxygen
